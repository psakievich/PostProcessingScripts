# Sierra Python Postprocessing Scripts

This repository contains scripts for post processing using python. 
The emphasis is on exodus files, and sierra products.
Some scripts rely on paraview/vtk modules and others utilize the exodus.py module.

In general the emphasis of the repository is for post-processing CFD
results, but other disciplines are welcome to hack files and share as needed.
